##  Overview

### &#127758;&#127777;  Terrestrial Planetary Boundary Status
`calc_status()` calculate the status of the boundaries based on &#127793; **LPJmL Simulations** depending on ...
1. &#127899; Scenario configuration
2. &#127760; Spatial scale: global, sub-global, grid
3. &#128346; Time span and resolution
4. &#128209; Methodological approach

and returns the status of each underlying control variable.


### &#127912; Status Visualization
`plot_status()` visualize the &#127777; status of the &#127758; boundaries based on the calculated control variables either as a &#128506; map or a &#128200; time series plot.
