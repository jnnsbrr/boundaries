\arguments{
\item{files_scenario}{list with variable names and corresponding file paths
(character string) of the scenario LPJmL run. All needed files are
provided in XXX. E.g.: list(leaching = "/temp/leaching.bin.json")}

\item{files_reference}{list with variable names and corresponding file paths
(character string) of the reference LPJmL run. All needed files are
provided in XXX. E.g.: list(leaching = "/temp/leaching.bin.json"). If not
needed for the applied approach, set to NULL.}

\item{spatial_scale}{character. Spatial resolution, available options
are \code{"subglobal"} (at the biome level, default), \code{"global"} and \code{"grid"}}

\item{time_span_scenario}{time span to be used for the scenario run, defined
as a character string, e.g. \code{as.character(1982:2011)} (default)}

\item{time_span_reference}{time span to be used for the scenario run, defined
as an integer vector, e.g. \code{as.character(1901:1930)}. Can differ in offset
and length from \code{time_span_scenario}! If \code{NULL} value of \code{time_span_scenario}
is used}

\item{approach}{approach (character string) to be used , currently available
approach is \code{"steffen2015"}}

\item{time_aggregation_args}{list of arguments to be passed to
\code{\link{aggregate_time}} (see for more info). To be used for time
series analysis}

\item{config_args}{list of arguments to be passed on from the model
configuration.}

\item{thresholds}{list with deforestation thresholds for defining safe,
increasing risk and high risk zone. Default based on Steffen et al. 2015 if
thresholds set to NULL (https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1259855):
for gridded and biome scale application:
`list(pb = list(temperate = 0.5, tropical = 0.15, boreal = 0.15),
highrisk = list(temperate = 0.7, tropical = 0.4, boreal = 0.4))
for global scale application:
list(holocene = 0, pb = 0.25, highrisk = 0.46)
pb = threshold between safe zone and increasing risk zone
(e.g. 50\% for boreal forest with default value)
highrisk = threshold between increasing risk and high risk zone}

\item{eurasia}{logical. If \code{spatial_scale} = \code{"subglobal"} merge continents
Europe and Asia to avoid arbitrary biome cut at europe/asia border.
Defaults to \code{TRUE}}
