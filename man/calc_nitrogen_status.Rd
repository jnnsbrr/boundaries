\arguments{
\item{path_scenario}{output directory (character string) of the scenario
LPJmL run where binary files (soon with metafiles) are written}

\item{path_reference}{output directory (character string) of the reference
\itemize{
\item if used - \verb{method == "braun2022_minusref}
}}

\item{time_span_scenario}{time span to be used for the scenario run, defined
as an integer vector, e.g. \code{1982:2011} (default)}

\item{time_span_reference}{time span to be used if scenario run used, defined
as an integer vector, e.g. \code{1901:1930}. Can differ in offset and length from
\code{time_span_scenario}! If \code{NULL} value of \code{time_span_scenario} is used}

\item{method}{method (character string) to be used , currently available
method is \code{"braun2022"} based on unpublished suggestion by Johanna Braun.
Second method option is \code{"braun2022_minusref"} to subtract reference run
output}

\item{cut_arid}{double. Exclude boundary calculations below the defined
threshold for aridity (annual precipitation / annual potential
evapotranspiration); Default: 0.2}

\item{cut_runoff}{double. Exclude boundary calculations below the defined
runoff threshold; Default: 0 mm per year (no treshold)}

\item{with_groundwater_denit}{logical. Include global assumptions made on
groundwater denitrification losses. Defaults to TRUE ( = simulated leaching
is multiplied with 0.71 based on simulated denitrification losses in ground
water from Bouwman et al 2013)}

\item{pb_thresholds}{list with upper and lower threshold for N concentration
(mg N/l) in runoff to surface water
Default: upper = 2.5, lower = 1
(based on de Vries et al. 2013, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cosust.2013.07.004)
Alternative: upper = 5, lower = 2
(based on Schulte-Uebbing et al. 2022,
https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-05158-2:
"we used a threshold for N concentration in run-off to surface water. This
threshold was set to 5.0â€‰mgN/l, based on the assumption that on average 50\%
of N entering surface water is removed through retention and sedimentation"))}

\item{prefix_monthly_output}{character. Provide a prefix if required for
monthly LPJmL output files, e.g. \code{"m"} for \code{"mdischarge.bin"} instead of
\code{"discharge.bin"} (default is \code{""})}

\item{avg_nyear_args}{list of arguments to be passed to
\link[pbfunctions]{average_nyear_window} (see for more info). To be used for
time series analysis}

\item{read_args}{list of arguments for reading output.}
